The core reason for that is how this plugin\n * interacts with Uppy's current pipeline design. The pipeline can handle files in steps,\n * including preprocessing, uploading, and postprocessing steps. This plugin initially\n * was designed to do its work in a preprocessing step, and let XHRUpload deal with the\n * actual file upload as an uploading step. However, Uppy runs steps on all files at once,\n * sequentially: first, all files go through a preprocessing step, then, once they are all\n * done, they go through the uploading step.\n *\n * For S3, this causes severely broken behaviour when users upload many files. The\n * preprocessing step will request S3 upload URLs that are valid for a short time only,\n * but it has to do this for _all_ files, which can take a long time if there are hundreds\n * or even thousands of files. By the time the uploader step starts, the first URLs may\n * already have expired. If not, the uploading might take such a long time that later URLs\n * will expire before some files can be uploaded.\n *\n * The long-term solution to this problem is to change the upload pipeline so that files\n * can be sent to the next step individually. That requires a breaking change, so it is\n * planned for some future Uppy version.\n *\n * In the mean time, this plugin is stuck with a hackier approach: the necessary parts\n * of the XHRUpload implementation were copied into this plugin, as the MiniXHRUpload\n * class, and this plugin calls into it immediately once it receives an upload URL.\n * This isn't as nicely modular as we'd like and requires us to maintain two copies of\n * the XHRUpload code, but at least it's not horrifically broken :)\n */\n// If global `URL` constructor is available, use it\nvar URL_ = typeof URL === 'function' ?
